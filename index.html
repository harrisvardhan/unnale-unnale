<div class="into">
  <p>I am a huge fan of Unnale Unnale (UU) from the moment I watched it. I was on cloud nine. And I think all the youngsters and youth who watched the movie 14 years ago must have felt the same. I did hear of it when I was a kid, but the young me despised movies. Additionally, I was studying in a boarding school rendering any chance to watch movies impossible. I started watching movies sometime around my 7th grade and since then movies have been a thing close to my heart. I can immediately point out a list of movies that I love and would love to watch again and again. Recently, I have started to watch romcom movies and the one which was always on my list was Unnale Unnale (UU). This happened on a normal day at my job. Since we have the opportunity to work from home, a thought struck me and I immediately downloaded UU from the web. I know its wrong, but I could not find any official streaming platforms offering UU. </p>
  <p>As soon as my work gave up, I sat down to watch this movie and boy, <b>I watched it 10 times in a span of 4 days. That is 2.5 hrs X 10 times = 25 hrs!</b> There are parts of the movie that may seem illogical, but hey, then what is the point of movies? Movies are an escape to "avoid" one's own reality. It is a fantasy. Any realist person will have a hard time watching movies like this, but to those people: Love is something that can happen anytime and anywhere and to anyone.</p>
  <p>Coming back to UU, I was awestruck at the setting and the screenplay of the movie. Tamil movie makers in the early 2000s had to ensure there were many elements of orthodox behaviour in their movies so as to be accepted by the general audience without trash talking. But here comes Jeeva (UU's director) who makes a beautiful film of a love triangle set in Melbourne, Australia. Modern elements like girls visiting strip clubs, and girls going on-site for job opportunities (but not limited) are shown in this movie which makes it fun to watch. Anyone watching the movie now, will totally appreciate the culture shown in this film.  </p>
  <p>80% of UU was almost shot at Australia, and I have ingrained almost every scene, dialogue and most importantly the locations. I've had the habit of googling locations of movie shooting locations since teenage. I don't know why but, I always felt that locations bring the movie characters, set pieces, and emotions to life. Hence, my motive to create this website to showcase the different locations that were used in filming UU.</p>
  <p>If you have not watched the movie, then there are <b>(beware!) spoliers ahead.</b>To those who enjoyed the film, enjoy the trip down memory lane. I more inclined to Deepika's and Karthik's relationship than Jhansi's. So, the list might be subjective. But I will try my best to stay objective and include all the locations shown in the film.</p>

  <p class="disclaimer"><b>DISCLAIMER: This post is not to promote the movie. I am a huge fan of this movie and I am not marketing. I want everyone to feel my love toward this piece of art. And in turn, feel warmth in their hearts as well.</b></p>

  <h2>Shooting Locations</h2>

  <div class="into-location">
    <p>Most of the film was shot in the <b>Melbourne Docklands area, VIC, Australia</b>. Indeed, a beautiful place with skyscrapers, bridges, and in the middle of it all, is a dock on the Yarra River.</p>

    <p>I've tried my best to list all the locations in a chronological order of events happening throughout the film.</p>

    <p class="effort"> <b>Also to remeber, I did my own research in finding and listing the location coordinates. I did not enlist the production companies' or actors' help while researching. This took a chunk of my time, but I am grateful for it. My idea was to let everyone know these locations, so that they can live the moment by visiting these places.</b> </p>
